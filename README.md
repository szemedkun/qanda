# Question Answering System
## Made as a Capstone Project in Galvanize's Data Science Program

### Introduction
The goal of the project is to build a model that understands a set of factual sentences to be able to answer questions based on the facts. For example, 
> Mary is in the bathroom. Mary moved to the Bedroom. John traveled to the hallway.
> Where is Mary?
The model should know that Mary is in the Bedroom.

### Dataset


### Model

#### RNN and LSTM

#### Word Embedding


I completed this project in just over two weeks time, so not everything is as perfect as I would have liked it to be.
